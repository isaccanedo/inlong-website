## 1.3.0 Features Details

### Abstracting Load node operations
Manager abstracts Load nodes to support easy expansion of Load node resources and greatly reduce the development time of a Load node
This part of the feature was contributed by @ciscozhou

### Add permission authentication for Manager Open Api
In the old version, the Manager Open Api can be accessed anonymously, and in the new version, it is implemented using the Apache Shiro framework.
Login authentication method based on Basic Access Authentication, this part of the function was contributed by @woofyzhao

### Enhanced collection of file data and k8s logs
Version 1.3.0 enhances the collection of file data and k8s data, in which file collection supports regular expression custom line breaks, so that multiple lines can be merged and folded
In addition, the new version of Agent supports full and incremental collection of file content. This part of the function was contributed by @ganfengtan

### DataProxy adds c++ sdk capability
In addition to the current java client, DataProxy has added c++ client capabilities, which are provided by @pocozh

### Supports multiple udf and join operators
The new version of Sort supports three kinds of Temporal Join\ Lookup Join \ Interval Join, this part of the function was contributed by @yunqingmoswu
Most community users mentioned the need for encryption and decryption and Json Udf, this part of the function was contributed by @Emsnap and @Emhui

### Sort connector supports indicator reporting function
The new version of Sort Connector supports Flink built-in indicator reporting of various Connectors. External indicator systems such as Prometheus can directly obtain the number and rate of task data read and write.
In addition, the new version also supports InLong Audit Audit data reporting, which is contributed by @pacigong, @Emsnap, @thesumery @Oneal65 @yunqingmoswu

### Manager supports the creation of resources in multiple flow directions
In version 1.3.0, Manager added the creation of some storage resources:
