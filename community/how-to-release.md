---

This article mainly introduces how to release a new version for Apache InLong in accordance with the Apache requirements. For more guideline, you can refer the following links:
- [ASF Release Creation Process](https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html)
- [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)

:::caution
For binary distribution packages, it is necessary to check that the new version does not contain third-party dependencies of class x, including direct reference and indirect reference parts.
:::

## Add GPG Key
:::note
This section is refer to [Cryptography with OpenPGP](https://infra.apache.org/openpgp.html), ** only for release manager who is the first time to release. **
:::

### Install GPG
For more details, please ref to [Official website](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html), configurations under Mac OS:
```shell
$ brew install gpg
# check the version, should be 2.x
$ gpg --version
```

### Generate GPG Key
:::caution
- Name is best to keep consistent with your full name of Apache ID
- The mailbox used is apache. It is recommended that pg -k view all the Key ID. If the first one is not the Key ID of the apache mailbox, if you need to specify the Key ID in the step for encryption operation, the parameter is -u
- Make sure that there is only one key, and delete the keys of other spare mailboxes first
- Name is best to only use English to avoid garbled
:::

```shell
$ gpg --full-gen-key

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

# command for sending your key id to key server
$ gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --send-key <key id>
# Among them, the keyserver list is: https://sks-keyservers.net/status/, which is automatically synchronized with each other, you can choose any one of them.
```

### Check whether the GPG Key is created successfully
Uploading takes about one minute, after that, you can check it by your email at `https://pgpkeys.mit.edu/`.

### Upload the GPG public key to SVN repo
:::note
The svn repository of the DEV branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/inlong

The svn repository of the Release branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/inlong
:::

- Add the public key to KEYS in the dev branch to release the RC version
```shell
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/inlong /tmp/inlong-dist-dev
$ cd inlong-dist-dev
# # Append your key to the KEYS file
$ gpg --export --armor YOUR_NAME@apache.org >> KEYS 
# Later on, if you are asked to enter a username and password, just use your apache username and password.
$ svn ci -m "add gpg key for YOUR_NAME" 
```

- Add the public key to the KEYS in the release branch for releasing official version
```shell
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/inlong /tmp/inlong-dist-release
$ cd inlong-dist-release
$ gpg --export --armor YOUR_NAME@apache.org >> KEYS 
$ svn ci -m "add gpg key for YOUR_NAME" 
```

### Upload the GPG public key to your Github account
 Enter https://github.com/settings/keys to add GPG KEYS. Please bind the email address used in the GPG key to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/emails), if you find "unverified" after adding it.

## Maven settings
Adding `<servers>/<profiles>` configurations in your maven `settings.xml` with correct values:
```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
        <username>{Your Apache ID}</username>
        <password>{Your Apache Password}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
        <id>apache.releases.https</id>
        <username>{Your Apache ID}</username>
        <password>{Your Apache Password}</password>
    </server>
</servers>
<profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>apache-release</id>
      <properties>
        <gpg.keyname>{Your GPG Key ID}</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.useagent>true</gpg.useagent>
        <gpg.passphrase>{Password for you GPG key}</gpg.passphrase>
      </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

## Build
The following `release_version` is the upcoming release number, such as 1.4.0; `rc_version` is Release Candidate, such as RC0, RC1...; `KEY_ID` is your GPG Key ID.

### Prepare branch
- Create the release branch from the main version branch and modify the POM version number and CHANGES.md. For example, create `release-1.4.0` from `branch-1.4`

- check the code, including whether compile, unit test, RAT check, Docker images etc.
```shell
# build check
$ mvn clean package -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
# RAT check
$ mvn apache-rat:check
# Docker images
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdocker
```

:::caution
Make sure code check is pass before executing next step, including compile success, unit test pass, RAT check pass etc.
:::

### create tag
Create a tag with annotation:
```shell
$ git_tag=${release_version}-${rc_version}
$ export GPG_TTY=`tty` && git config user.signingkey ${KEY_ID}
$ git tag -s $git_tag -m "Tagging the ${release_version} first Releae Candidate (Candidates start at zero)"
```

### Building source code package 
```shell
$ mkdir /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}
$ git archive --format=tar.gz --output="/tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}/apache-inlong-${release_version}-src.tar.gz" --prefix="apache-inlong-${release_version}/" $git_tag
```

### Building binary package
```shell
# go to directory where the source code package stay
$ cd /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version} 
# uncompress the tar file
$ tar xzvf apache-inlong-${release_version}-src.tar.gz 
# go to the source code directory
$ cd apache-inlong-${release_version}
# build binary package
$ mvn compile clean install package -DskipTests
# for signature convenient, copy the binary package to the source code directory
$ cp ./inlong-distribution/target/apache-inlong-${release_version}-bin.tar.gz /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}/
# for signature convenient, copy the connectors binary package to the source code directory
$ cp ./inlong-distribution/target/apache-inlong-${release_version}-sort-connectors.tar.gz /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}/
```

### Sign the source package/binary package/sha512
```shell
# 进入源码包目录
$ cd /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}
# calculate SHA512
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg -u ${KEY_ID} --print-md SHA512 $i > $i.sha512 ; done 
# calculate signature
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg -u ${KEY_ID} --armor --output $i.asc --detach-sig $i ; done 
```

### Check the signature/sha512
Ref：[check the candidate version](how-to-verify.md), e.g. check the signature:
```shell
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg -u ${KEY_ID} --verify $i.asc $i ; done
```

## Prepare for Apache release
### Deploy jar to Apache Nexus repository
```shell
# go to the source code directory
$ cd /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}/apache-inlong-${release_version}
# start to upload, and make sure the settings.xml is the file updated before
$ mvn -DskipTests deploy -Papache-release -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
```

### Upload tag to git repository
```shell
# under the directory where you create the tag
$ git push origin ${release_version}-${rc_version}
$ git push origin release-${release_version}
```

### Upload tar file to dist repo
- Checkout dist repo to local directory
```shell
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/inlong /tmp/inlong-dist-dev
```

- Add source and binary files and commit to SVN repository
```shell
$ cd /tmp/inlong-dist-dev
# create a directory named by version
$ mkdir ${release_version}-${rc_version} 
# copy source code and signature package to the versioned directory
$ cp /tmp/apache-inlong-${release_version}-${rc_version}/*tar.gz* ${release_version}-${rc_version}/ 
# check svn status
$ svn status
# addi to svn
$ svn add ${release_version}-${rc_version}
# check svn status
$ svn status
# commit to SVN remote server
$ svn commit -m "prepare for ${release_version} ${rc_version}"     
```

### Close Apache Staging repository
