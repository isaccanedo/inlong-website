For bug reports: a short reproduction of the problem would be more than welcomed. If you have logs, the specific part of the log with the error message or stack trace. Attaching the entire log can be useful. If you have already tried to debug the issue describe the steps you have already done. Even if that result was that you were not able to reproduce the issue.
